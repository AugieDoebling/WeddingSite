      <h3 class="subhead">Where will we be sleeping?</h3>
      <p class="a">Included as part of our wedding weekend, everyone is invited to stay in the camp cabins on Friday and Saturday nights, and we strongly encourage everyone who is able to do so. This is a key part of our “summer camp” vision for the weekend! 😊(Of course, we understand if there are individual circumstances that prevent you from being able to stay in the cabins–please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns).</p>

      <h3 class="subhead">How many cabins are there, and how many beds in each cabin?</h3>
      <p class="a">There are 10 cabins and each cabin can sleep up to 10 people.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead">What are the cabins like?</h3>
      <p class="a">Each cabin contains five bunk beds, for a total of 10 beds per cabin. Each cabin has a bathroom with a sink and a shower, plus an extra sink with a big mirror.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead">Do I need to bring my own sheets or sleeping bag?</h3>
      <p class="a">Yes, you must bring your own! The bunk beds have mattresses, but no linens. Please bring your own sleeping bag and pillow. If you don’t own a sleeping bag, you can also bring a fitted sheet and blanket.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead">Will cabins be assigned?</h3>
      <p class="a">Yes, we will assign our guests to their cabins. We will make sure that our guests are assigned to a cabin with others who they know and/or will feel comfortable with. We anticipate that most cabins will not be totally full–it will likely be around 7 to 8 guests per cabin.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead">Will I be able to stay with my party/plus-one?</h3>
      <p class="a">Yes, we plan to keep all parties together in the cabin assignments. </p>
